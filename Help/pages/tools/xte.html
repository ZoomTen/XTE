      XTE - Xtreme Text Editor<br>
      <span>Literally Notepad with extras</span>
		</h1>
		<h2>XTE</h2>
		<p>
			Isn't it funny, a whole manual tucked inside a chapter of the program's
			own help. Alright, let's take a look...
		</p>
		<h3>Interface Operations</h3>
		<img src="images/xte_interface.bmp" class="figureimg" alt="XTE's interface, showing a menu at the top, two tabs of ASM files being opened (with one visible in the main text area), a sidebar with a calculator and notes, and a status bar, showing the current line, column and selected characters, among other information.">
		<hr>
		<h4>Menu</h4>
		<p>
			The following menus are available:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>File</b> - Basic file operations. Create a new tab for a new file,
				open, save, close file, look at recent files, you get the picture.
				You can also print text files if you want.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Edit</b> - Editing operations, undo/redo, cut/copy/paste... but there's
				also some other functions such as:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Backup</b> - Backs up the current file. <b>Ctrl+K</b> is
							the hotkey for this. If your file is [FILENAME].asm, your
							backup will be [FILENAME].bak.
						</li>
						<li><b>Read Only</b> - Disables or enables editing inside the
							current tab.
						</li>
						<li><b>Revert</b> - Reverts any changes made to the current file
							since the last save. In other words, it basically reloads
							the current file.
						</li>
						<li><b>Insert Date/Time</b> - Inserts the current date and time
							at cursor position, according to your computer's locale.
						</li>
					</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Format</b> - Edits the appearance of the script area. You may change
					the colors and fonts here.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Options</b> - You can adjust how the program works here.
					<ul>
						<li><b>Always on Top</b> - Sets the program to always be displayed
							on top of other windows.
						</li>
						<li><b>Minimize to System Tray</b> - In case you don't want to
							clutter up your task bar. (A little buggy for now)
						</li>
						<li><b>Remember Window Size</b> - If you want to have the program
							be opened at the same size as when you closed it.
						</li>
						<li><b>Auto Save</b> - Opens this dialog box that lets you adjust
							how often should files be auto-saved.
							<img src="images/autosave.bmp" class="figureimg" alt="The auto-save dialog, showing a checkbox that says Save RBC/RBH/RBT/ASM files automatically every:, with a slider that adjusts how many seconds until the file is autosaved.">
						</li>
						<li><b>Show Recent Files</b> - Affects the <b>File</b> menu.
						</li>
						<li><b>Line Numbers</b> - Toggles displaying line numbers in the
							script view.
						</li>
						<li><b>Inline Command Help</b> - When you're typing a script, this
							option tries to assist you in setting parameters for a command
							or directive, like so:
							<img src="images/inlinehelp.bmp" class="figureimg" alt="XTE's inline help system, showing a partially typed command, with a tooltip showing the current parameters left to type.">
						</li>
						<li><b>Associate</b> - This enables XTE to be associated with a few file formats.
						</li>
					</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Tools</b> - Additional tools to assist in script writing.
					<ul>
						<li><b>Script Templates</b> - (I haven't touched this yet, so
							ignore it for now. It's supposed to have templates you
							can use as a base)
						</li>
						<li><b>Text Adjuster</b> - Will be explained later in the
							document.
						</li>
					</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Help</b> - Help files, command reference and XTE version info.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Script Area</h4>
		<p>
			The script area is, of course, where you'll do most of your work.
			Line numbers are enabled by default to orient yourself more easily in
			long scripts.
		</p>
		<h4>Status Bar</h4>
		<p>
			Displays various information about the current script. It can be divided
			into the following panels:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>File Status</b> - When first loaded or idle, it will show
				tips. When a file is loaded, it will display how much time it took
				to show the file.
			</li>
			<li><b>File Info</b> - Shows where exactly in the file is the cursor placed
				- and if there is anything selected, it will show how many characters
				there are in the selection
			</li>
			<li><b>Software Attribution</b> - Shows the author and year of the program.
			</li>
			<li><b>Dirty Indicator</b> - This indicator will turn black if the file
				is edited but has not been saved
			</li>
			<li><b>Caps Lock</b> - Turns black when Caps Lock is enabled. You can
				also toggle it by double clicking on it, which affects the actual
				keyboard's status.
			</li>
			<li><b>Num Lock</b> - Same as before, but with the Num Lock toggle instead.
			</li>
			<li><b>Scroll Lock</b> - Same as before, but with the Scroll Lock toggle.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Calculator</h4>
		<p>
			A part of the side bar, the calculator pretty much does what you expect.
			Saves good time diving for <code>calc.exe</code> (or, if it's open, trying
			to find it in the taskbar). It allows for easy conversion between binary,
			hexadecimal and decimal numbers, as well as perform your basic calculations.
			The numbers displayed are not prefixed, as its base is indicated by the
			current mode selection.
		</p>
		<p>
			(At the moment, most operations won't work in binary mode)
		</p>
		<p>Explanation of the extra buttons:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>and</b> - Performs a bitwise AND with another number.
			</li>
			<li><b>xor</b> - Performs a bitwise exclusive OR (XOR, EXOR, EOR) with
				another number.
			</li>
			<li><b>or</b> - Performs a bitwise OR with another number.
			</li>
			<li><b>not</b> - Performs a logical NOT. Compared to the <b>+/-</b>
				operation (which does a 2's complement), this simply does a 1's complement.
			</li>
			<li><b>lsh</b> - Performs a bitwise left shift by positions indicated by another number.
			</li>
			<li><b>rsh</b> - Performs a bitwise right shift by positions indicated by another number.
			</li>
			<li><b>ptr</b> - Converts a hexadecimal number (as ROM address) into a
				Game Boy Advance pointer.
			</li>
			<li><b>ofs</b> - Converts a hexadecimal number (as a Game Boy Advance pointer)
				into a ROM address.
			</li>
			<li><b>MS</b> - Saves the currently displayed number into calculator memory (1 number only!).
			</li>
			<li><b>MR</b> - Recalls the saved number from memory.
			</li>
			<li><b>MC</b> - Clears the calculator memory.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Notes</h4>
		<p>
			In more mainstream programmer's text editors, notes can usually be displayed
			side-by-side with the main file. This, however, adds a bit of work (need to
			find or create a notes file, need to adjust the editor for comfortable
			editing, etc.). This program offers a built-in sticky as part of the sidebar
			for things like making a note of constants or details of scripts.
		</p>
		<p>
			The notes typed in this area is automatically saved at Notes.txt of the
			app's folder, and can be opened using any text editor.
		</p>
		<h4>Command Help</h4>
		<img src="images/commandhelp.bmp" class="figureimg" alt="XTE's command help showing details of 'takeitem'. Details: Removes an instance of item x quantity from the players bag. Parameters include Item ID and how much.">
		<p>
		As the name might suggest, it provides an overview of various scripting commands.
		The command help may be explored freely to see what's possible, or can be called
		through the script area. When called through the script area, it is context-aware.
		This means, if your cursor is located at a line which contains <i>sjump</i>, it will open the
		details for the <i>sjump</i> command.
		</p>
		<h4>Text Adjuster</h4>
		<img src="images/textadjuster.bmp" class="figureimg" alt="XTE's text adjuster window, showing the beginning portion of the Bee Movie script.">
		<p>
			This feature remains useful, and even more so when applied to GBC hacking,
			as unlike the GBA games which use variable width text, GBC scripts use
			fixed width text.
		</p>
		<p>
			Using this tool, there's no need to futz around with making comments that
			mark the maximum number of characters supported. Just type in your text,
			press <b>Convert</b>, and then <b>Insert</b> it into the text. You can
			also still set a custom character limit. Either way, the textbox on the
			left of the character limit will show how close you are to breaching
			the character limit. (green to red)
		</p>
		<p>
			To create a new paragraph, create one blank line between the current
			paragraph and the next (press Enter twice).
		</p>
