		<h2>The History Lesson...</h2>
		<p>
      XSE is a program
			written in 2008 to facilitate easy script editing of
			the mainline Pok&eacute;mon games on the Game Boy
			Advance. XSE complements Advance Map (a map
			editing tool) quite nicely, and is usually used
			together.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was an all-in-one scripting tool, as it can decompile
			scripts from the game ROM as well as compile scripts to the
			ROM. Integration with other tools such as the Free Space
			Finder as well as Advance Trainer comes built-in. It also
			comes with a hex viewer, ROM resizer, batch compiler, text
			adjuster... point is: it has it all. It's one of
			<strong>the</strong> tools of choice of the GBA
			hackers of the era.
		</p>
		<p>
			That being said, there are a few limitations. For example:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>No syntax highlighting</li>
			<li>No way to enter TAB inside the code editor</li>
			<li>Calculator only converts between hexadecimal and decimal</li>
			<li>Limited space for notes</li>
			<li>Sidebar not resizeable</li>
			<li>Written in Visual Basic 6 (okay, maybe it doesn't count)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			However, since the tool is <em>extremely</em><small>(heh)</small> useful, most people didn't mind
			these limitations.
