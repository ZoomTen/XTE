		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			XTE is a text editor, forked off the
			eXtreme Script Editor (XSE).
		</p>
		<h2>What's New?</h2>
		<p>
			This fork removes the very purpose of the original tool,
			by gutting out every piece of scripting support. The end
			result, is that you basically have a glorified Notepad.
		</p>
		<p>
			And instead of being suited for the GBA Pok&eacute;mon games,
			it's now suited for the GB/GBC ones. Specifically, its
			disassemblies. With fully complete disassembly and
			mostly documented code, it's become easier than ever to
			do drastic changes and add many features to the games.
			As for scripting: just open
			a text file, hack away and recompile!
		</p>
		<p>
			Incidentally, you also have these over vanilla XSE.
			(Maybe I'll make a version of XSE with these changes)
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Tab indentation is possible in the code editor</li>
			<li>Adds a binary mode in the calculator</li>
			<li>Sidebar notes expand to the height of the window</li>
			<li>Can operate on files originally with Unix/Linux line
				endings (which is more often these days). Do note that
				it <strong>automatically converts these files to Windows
				line endings</strong> to do so.
			</li>
			<li>You can jump to a line number through the command line
				now, just invoke <code>XTE.exe YourFileHere.asm:14</code>
				to jump to line 14 of that file.
			</li>
		</ul>
