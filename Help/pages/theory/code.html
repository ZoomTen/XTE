		<h2>The Code</h2>
		<p>
			If all you're doing is just scripting, you probably don't need to worry
			about assembly too much. However, it helps vastly if you learn a little bit
			of it. Assembly, in this case, means Game Boy assembly. Being a classic
			console, its assembly language isn't very complex. No fixed code/data sections,
			at most you have two operands per instruction.
