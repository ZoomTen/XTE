		<h2>The Math</h2>
		<p>
			So, most of us are used to counting from 1, 2, 3, ... 9, and
			then 10. It makes sense, since we have 10 fingers in total. That's
			called the <b>decimal</b> system. It's also known as <b>base 10</b>
			because we use 10 symbols in total: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
		</p>
		<p>
			Computers on the other hand, at their core is just a bunch of switches
			that can do magic things. Like a light switch: on or off. Since a computer
			has two states, we can think of 0 as "off" and 1 as "on". How do you
			make it "count?"
		</p>
		<h3>Binary</h3>
		<p>
			Imagine a mechanical lap counter. Whenever you press the button,
			the rightmost digit increases. When it's showing 9, that digit
			rolls back to 0, and the digit to the left of it increases by 1.
			Same thing applies to the rest of the digits. Now picture that,
			but whenever a digit is 1, it rolls back to 0. That's <b>binary</b>.
			It's also called <b>base 2</b> since it only operates on two symbols
			(0, 1).
		</p>
		<p>
			So if you were to count on it, you would go 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111
			and so on.
		</p>
		<p>(In this document, binary numbers will be prefixed with %. We'll use
			other symbols to differentiate a number in some system with decimal.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, how do you express a number like this in decimal? Consider:
		</p>
		<div class="equation">
			<div>Decimal to Decimal</div>
			<code>
				149 = 1*100 + 4*10 + 9*1<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 100 + 40 + 9<br> 
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 149
			</code>
		</div>
		<p>
			Okay, that seems obvious enough. 1 is in the hundreds place, 4 is in the
			tens place, and 9 is in the ones place. Now what about %10110?
		</p>
		<div class="equation">
			<div>Binary to Decimal</div>
			<code>
				%10110 = 1*16 + 0*8 + 1*4 + 1*2 + 0*1<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 0<br> 
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 22
			</code>
		</div>
		<p>
			Instead of ones, tens, hundreds, we now have ones, twos, and fours.
			That mean, instead of using 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... (each multiplier
			itself just multipled by 10), we use:
			1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, ... (each one is doubled instead)
		</p>
		<h3>Hexadecimal</h3>
		<p>
			We usually group long numbers to make them easier to read, because
			nobody wants to read long strings of symbols that barely mean anything.
			In my case, we usually group it in threes, e.g. 54389537458 = 54,389,537,458.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the same way, in binary, nobody wants to look at a really long string of
			0's and 1's. After a while, it's decided to split binary digits into
			fours. So, now you have a collection of 4-bit numbers. And for some reason, they call it a <b>nybble</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's start with %1011101010101000. We split it like so: %1011 %1010 %1010 %1000. Seems good enough, but we can do better. Take each nybble, and
			grab a symbol that represents it.
		</p>
		<p>
			It just so happens that the maximum possible value of a nybble is %1111,
			which in decimal is 15. But 15 is two symbols (1 and 5), but we want just
			one. Why don't we use letters? Because we clearly don't have enough of them in math.
		</p>
		<p>
			Enter <b>base 16</b>. Or, <b>hexadecimal</b>. (Glad it isn't
			called sexadecimal!). We have the usual 0-9 numbers, but after 9 we
			cross over to A, B, C, D, E, F, and finally after that we get to 10.
		</p>
		<p>(In this document, hexadecimal numbers will be prefixed with $)
		</p>
		<p>
			Representing these kinds of numbers in decimal, then:
		</p>
		<div class="equation">
			<div>Hexadecimal to Decimal</div>
			<code>
				$32F = 3*256 + 2*16 + 15*1<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 768 + 32 + 15<br> 
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 815
			</code>
		</div>
		<p>
			Here we use 1, 16, 256, 4096, 65536, ... (we multiply by 16 each time)
		</p>
		<p>
			So, taking our nybbles and turning them into hexadecimal, we get:
			$B $A $A $8. We can then group these every two nybbles, making
			two 8-bit numbers (known as <b>bytes</b>): $BA $A8. In fact, if you
			open a file in a hex editor, these kinds of numbers are exactly what you see.
		</p>
		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p>
			Decimal, binary and hexadecimal are just three ways to represent a
			number. Just as a word can be in different languages but mean the
			same thing, a number can be expressed in different ways but still
			have the same value. A 25A in hexadecimal is the same as 602 in decimal, just as a "Hello" in English is the same as "Konnichiwa" in
			Japanese.
